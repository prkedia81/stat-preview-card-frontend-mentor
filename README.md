## Overview
I am literally a newbie to Frontend development. It took me more than an hour to come up with this so please
judge me keeping that it mind. I do not know how to create different versions for mobile and web right now. In this project, I decided to stick with desktop view. I am still not sure what's the best way to align all the elements. I have used only the very fundamental elements and attributes. This is probably why I cannot replicate the exact look of the design. If you have any suggestions for improvements please do give them to
me. Thanks!
